# Photo Grid

Self host-able photography portfolio coupled with [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) headless CMS for asset management.

## Getting Started

Note that this is a monorepo containing the Photo grid app and its admin interface. It uses NPM [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces?v=true) to manage monorepo related tasks.

Please refer to the `.nvmrc` file for the required Node version prior to installation.

1. Run `npm install` in the root directory
